            <h3>Marvel just KILLED a major Avenger in Civil War II and it's one of these 'Big 6'</h3>
            <p>Marvel Editor in Chief, Axel Alonso has spoken out about the upcoming death.

They launched a missile, which was re-directed by Iron Man into the wormhole opened by Loki. The bomb detonated in outer space, destroying the Chitauri hive mind, while Stark passed out and began to plummet to Earth, only to be saved by the Hulk.Loki  taken into custody.</p>
